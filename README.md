# C# College Codes (1st Year Archive)

This repository contains my old C# code from my first year in college.
I’m keeping it here mainly for reference, nostalgia, and personal growth tracking.

## About

* Written during my **1st year of college**.
* Covers basic programming concepts in C#.
* Expect beginner-level code, experiments, and practice exercises.

## Purpose

* Preserve my early coding journey.
* Look back and see how much I’ve improved.
* Serve as a reminder of where it all started.

## Notes

* The code might not be polished or optimized.
* Some solutions may be outdated or could be written better today.
* This repo is more of a **time capsule** than a production project.
